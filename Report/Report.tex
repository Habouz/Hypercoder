\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This report describes the implementation and analysis of an entropy-regularized autoencoder trained using PyTorch. The model aims to figure out the latent space by itself by incorporating both reconstruction loss and a custom entropic loss. We discuss the data pipeline, architecture, loss functions, training procedure, and experimental results, including interpretability of learned weights and latent codes.

\section{Introduction}
Autoencoders are unsupervised neural architectures designed to learn compact representations by reconstructing input data. While standard autoencoders minimize reconstruction error, their latent space is generally fixed with play over the structure of the latent space or interpretability. In this work, we enhance the autoencoder's capacity to learn to "compactify" the latent space by introducing an entropic regularization term.

\section{Theory and Background}
\subsection{Autoencoders}
Autoencoders are series of neural networks that encode input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decode it back to the original space. The architecture typically consists of an encoder, a bottleneck (latent space), and a decoder. The latent space has less neurons than the input, forcing the model to reduce the degrees of freedom (or better, dimension), thus learning a compressed representation of the input data. The output has the same shape as the input, and the model is trained by minimizing the difference between the input and output, usually using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

\subsection{Shannon Entropy}
Entropy, or Shannon Entropy, is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a system. A generally good interpretation of entropy is the expected number of bits needed to encode the output of a random variable in the most efficient way, or an asymptotic limit. For example, if my random variable takes 4 values with equal probability, say, (A, B, C, D), the entropy is 2 bits, because I can encode each value with 2 bits (00 for A, 01 for B, 10 for C, and 11 for D). However, if A happens more frequently than the others, say with probability 0.50, the entropy will be lower, as I can encode A with 1 bit (0) and the others with 2 bits (11 for B, 100 for C, and 101 for D), and my expected number of bits will be lower than 2 bits. 

Entropy is defined mathematically as:
\[H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \log(p_i)\]
where \(p_i\) is the probability of the \(i\)-th outcome of a random variable \(X\). When we use logarithm base 2, it has units of bits, but any other logarithm differs by a constant multiple.
It is not difficult to prove that the maximum entropy is achieved when all outcomes are equally likely, i.e., \(p_i = \frac{1}{n}\) for \(n\) outcomes, and minimized when one outcome has probability 1 and all others have probability 0. In other words, the more my distribution is clustered, the lower the entropy. For uniform distributions, the entropy will simply be \(\log(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of outcomes.

\subsection{Renyi Entropy}
Renyi entropy is a generalization of Shannon entropy, defined as:
\[H_\alpha(X) = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} \log \left(|| p ||_\alpha\right)\]
where \(|| \cdot ||_\alpha\) is \(\alpha-\)norm. 

A few special cases of Renyi entropy are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \(\alpha = 1\), it reduces to Shannon entropy.
    \item For \(\alpha = 0\), it reduces to the logarithm of the number of nonzero probabilities.
    \item For \(\alpha \to \infty\), it approaches the min-entropy, which is the negative logarithm of the maximum probability of any single outcome.
\end{itemize}

The intuition of Renyi entropy is that it generalizes the "logarithm of number of outcomes". Hence, the higher the \(\alpha\), the more it focuses on the most probable outcomes, while lower \(\alpha\) values consider all outcomes more equally.

\subsection{Entropic Compactifier Regularization}

In this subsection, we introduce how entropy can be used to create bottlenecks throughout the autoencoder architecture. The idea is to penalize the model for having more neurons in the bottleneck. But how do we do that? We can start with a fixed latent space size, say 20 neurons, and then assign to each neuron a weight that determines how "active" it is. There are two ways to do this: either sum the magnitude of the contributions of the incoming connections from the previous layer and add the biases, or sum the contributions of the outgoing connections to the next layer and add the biases. The first has the intuition of "Ah, this node is important! let's contrubute to it more", while the second has the intuition of "Ah, this node is important! let's use it more".

After evalutating the "activeness" of each neuron, we would like them to be more localized in the latent space. We can treat the weight distribution as a probability distribution after normalizing it, and then compute its entropy. We would like to minimize it, and the parameter \(\alpha\) controls how much we want to penalize the model for having more neurons in the bottleneck.

\subsection{Path Entropic Loss}

Another approach with dealing with bottlenecks is to consider all possible paths from the first layer to the last. Each path can be represented as a sequence of weights and biases, and we can assign a "cummulative" weight to each path by multiplying the weights and biases along it. Similar to the previous approach, the more weights the path has, the more "active" it is. A bottleneck can be created by penalizing the model for having more active paths, i.e. we want to localize the weights and biases into fewer paths. We hope that this localization will be "nice" and fall into one layer, creating a bottleneck. To do so we can do the same approach and calculate the entropy of the path distributions. Unfortunately, this approach is computationally expensive and scales up quickly, but as an advantage, it figures out the bottleneck location and size by itself.


\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Loading}
We use the MNIST dataset of $28\times 28$ grayscale handwritten digits to try to create a program that can generate number figures. PyTorch's \texttt{torchvision.datasets} provides an efficient pipeline. Data is normalized and batched for training.

\subsection{Model Architecture}
The autoencoder architecture is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input: Flattened $28\times 28$ image
    \item Encoder: Linear layers with ReLU activations, compressing to a latent dimension
    \item Bottleneck: Several layers with the same latent size, enabling information bottlenecking
    \item Decoder: Mirrors the encoder, reconstructing back to image shape
    \item Output: Sigmoid activation for pixel values in $[0,1]$
\end{itemize}

In this implementation, we do not seperate the network explicitly into an encoder and decoder. Remember that the goal is to let the network figure out the bottleneck by itself, so we do not need to specify it. However, we can still guide the network into encoder and decoder To make training more efficient

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption={Autoencoder Definition}]
class Autoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, extended_latent_dim=20):
        super().__init__()
        self.autoencoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(28*28, 64), nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, extended_latent_dim), nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(extended_latent_dim, extended_latent_dim), nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(extended_latent_dim, extended_latent_dim), nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(extended_latent_dim, 64), nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 28*28), nn.Sigmoid(),
            nn.Unflatten(1, (1, 28, 28))
        )
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Loss Function}
The total loss combines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reconstruction Loss:} Mean Squared Error (MSE) between input and output.
    \item \textbf{Entropic Loss:} Custom penalty on weights between latent layers to maximize entropy (spread) of internal representations.
\end{itemize}
\[
\text{Total Loss} = \lambda_1 \cdot \text{MSE} + \lambda_2 \cdot \text{EntropicLoss}
\]
with $\lambda_1 = 0.7$ and $\lambda_2 = 0.3$ in our experiments.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption={Loss Computation}]
recon = model(batch)
criterion_loss = criterion(recon, batch)
eloss = entropic_loss(W_l, W_r, B, alpha=1.0, beta=0.04)
loss = criterion_term * criterion_loss + entropy_term * eloss
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Training Procedure}
We train for 10 epochs using Adam optimizer. At each batch:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Forward pass
    \item Compute losses
    \item Backpropagation and parameter update
    \item Optionally, print weight statistics for monitoring
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experiments and Results}

    \fbox{Insert reconstructed MNIST images here}
    \caption{Sample reconstructed digits after training.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Latent Space Analysis}
To probe the effect of entropic loss, we analyze the weights of bottleneck layers and visualize their statistics (e.g., average magnitude, sparsity).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption={Extracting and Printing Weights}]
w2 = linear_layers[2].weight.detach().cpu().numpy()
print("Average weight of 2nd Linear Layer:", np.mean(np.abs(w2), axis=0))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Encoder/Decoder Splitting}
For downstream applications, the autoencoder is split into encoder and decoder submodules and saved for reuse:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption={Splitting and Saving}]
encoder = nn.Sequential(*list(model.autoencoder)[:7])
decoder = nn.Sequential(*list(model.autoencoder)[7:])
torch.save(encoder, "encoder_full.pth")
torch.save(decoder, "decoder_full.pth")
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Interpretation of Entropic Loss}
The entropic penalty leads to more distributed (less degenerate) weights in bottleneck layers, encouraging richer and more robust latent representations. The model avoids trivial or collapsed solutions in its latent code.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We demonstrated an autoencoder architecture regularized with entropic loss, trained on MNIST. The model yields high-quality reconstructions and more diverse internal representations. Future directions include testing on more complex data, ablation studies of entropy parameters, and visualization of latent space clustering.
